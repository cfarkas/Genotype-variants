# Genotype-variants: An streamlined pipeline for the genetic characterization of Genetically Engineered Mice (GEM) models based on NGS data. 

Pipeline Outline

Genotype Variants is an automated BASH/R pipeline for the adequate visualization of RNA-seq variants on the mouse mm10 build, based on VCF files (Variant Calling Format files, http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.3.pdf). The pipeline takes as input BAM files from RNA-Seq, whole exome sequencing (WES) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) from wild-type and KO/KI genotypes. The pipeline call variants in each sampÄºe with the Freebayes variant caller, intersect variants from each genotype and outputs filtered VCF files per genotype, genome-wide plots of variants and a summary of chromosomes with differential distribution of variants among genotypes. This pipeline can be fully implemented using the main galaxy tools (https://usegalaxy.org/). 

The input could be BAM files from a splice-aware aligner: e.g. HISAT2 or BAM files from Bowtie2 or BWA (form WES/WGS data)
                  
To collect variants, BAM files from the alignment of RNA-seq/WES/WGS reads are sorted and genome-wide simple diploid calling is performed with Freebayes (see https://github.com/ekg/freebayes). Raw VCF files are further processed using the VCFlib toolkit (https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib). VCF files needs to be intersected among biological replicates from each genotype (VCF-VCF intersect tool) and the resulting VCF file is then filtered using an adequate criteria. Finally, a variant normalization step is performed with the VcfAllelicPrimitives tool from VCFlib, simplifying multi-nucleotides variants (MNPs) into primitive alleles.  
The pipeline can be executed in two ways:

A) Galaxy to obtain the intersected VCF files per genotype and then in R (from windows and Max OSX)
B) Fully automated in BASH by using a simple config file.

Galaxy Pipeline:  
Go to https://usegalaxy.org/ and create an account. Users can also install Galaxy locally following these instructions: https://galaxyproject.org/admin/get-galaxy/

1) Input: Sorted BAM file from alignment (e.g HISAT)
2) FreeBayes: Simple diploid calling, default settings 
3) VCFfilter:  We suggest  -f "QUAL > 30 " (Depth over 10 reads), "DP > 10" (minimum Phred-scaled probability of error over 30) 
4) VcfAllelicPrimitives: Split allelic primitives into multiple VCF lines, default settings (Galaxy Version 0.0.3)
5) VCF-VCF Intersect: on WT and Null VCF files, mm10 build

At this step, users needs to execute the genotype_variants.R script (on windows or Mac OSX)

Script Outline

Inputted variants are binned every 10 million base pairs according to its chromosomal coordinates (mm10 build: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001635.26) and ordered in a contingency table. After this, frequency distribution of variants is tested by applying the Cochran-Armitage test for trend distribution, available in the DescTools package in R. (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DescTools/index.html). The program will generate a genome-wide plot of variants per genotype based on the ggplot2 R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) and a summary of chromosomes containing KO/KI-ligated variants, based on the frequency distribution of wild-type and KO/KI genotypes. 

R Dependences

The following R/Bioconductor packages are required for the script usage (see https://www.bioconductor.org/)

dplyr_0.7.4       
gridExtra_2.3     
reshape2_1.4.2    
ggplot2_2.2.1    
DescTools_0.99.23

Usage
1) Place genotype_variants.R and the VCF files (wild-type and KO/KI outputs after the galaxy pipeline) in the same folder
2) Open genotype_variants.R file through R (go to File --> Open Script/Document)
3) Execute all lines (Edit --> Select all, and then Edit --> Execute)
4) A prompted window will ask for the wild-type VCF file. Select it. 
5) A prompted window will ask for the KO/KI VCF file. Select it
6) Output: Genome-wide plot of variants per genotype (PDF file) and a summary of the Cochran-Armitage Test per chromosome (PDF file)
